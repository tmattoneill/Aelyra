## Development Notes

### Frontend Build System (Vite Migration)

The frontend has been migrated from Create React App to Vite for improved performance:

**Performance Improvements:**
- Dev server startup: ~200ms (vs 15+ seconds with CRA)
- Production builds: ~800ms (vs minutes with CRA)
- Hot module replacement: Nearly instantaneous
- Zero deprecation warnings from outdated dependencies

**Build Commands:**
- `npm start` or `npm run dev` - Development server
- `npm run build` - Production build (outputs to `dist/`)
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build
- `npm test` - Run tests with Jest

**Rebuild Instructions:**
```bash
# Standard rebuild (recommended)
cd frontend
npm install
npm start

# Full clean rebuild (only if needed)
cd frontend
rm package-lock.json
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
npm start
```

**Environment Variables:**
- Uses `VITE_` prefix instead of `REACT_APP_`
- Access via `import.meta.env` instead of `process.env`
- Vite 6.x for Node.js 18+ compatibility

### Database Management

**Migrations:**
```bash
# Create new migration after model changes
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Description of changes"

# Apply migrations
alembic upgrade head

# View migration history
alembic history
```

**Database Reset (Development):**
```bash
# WARNING: This deletes all data
rm playmaker.db
alembic upgrade head
```

## Production Deployment

Use the included deployment script for production deployments:

```bash
# Dry run to test deployment process
./deploy-prod.sh --dry-run

# Full deployment
./deploy-prod.sh
```

The script handles:
- Code updates from Git
- Database migrations
- Frontend build process
- Dependency installation
- Backup creation
- Error handling with automatic rollback

## Known Issues & Fixes

### Recently Fixed Issues
- âœ… **User Profile Overwrite Bug**: Fixed issue where custom first names were overwritten with Spotify username on each login
- âœ… **Vite Migration**: Successfully migrated from deprecated Create React App to Vite
- âœ… **Node.js Compatibility**: Vite downgraded to 6.x for Node.js 18+ compatibility
- âœ… **ES Module Support**: Updated configuration for proper ES module handling

### Current Limitations

**Technical Limitations:**
- **HTTP Development Only**: Uses HTTP with loopback addresses for Spotify OAuth compatibility
- **No Rate Limiting**: API endpoints have no rate limiting implemented
- **Single Database File**: SQLite database not suitable for high-concurrency production use

**Spotify API Limitations:**
- **OAuth Redirect Constraints**: Must use `http://127.0.0.1` (not `localhost`) for backend redirect URI
- **Track Availability**: Song availability varies by region and Spotify catalog changes
- **Playlist Permissions**: Requires explicit user authorization for playlist modification

**User Experience Limitations:**
- **No Playlist Editing**: Cannot modify playlists after creation (must recreate)
- **Session Tokens**: Spotify tokens require re-authentication on browser refresh
- **Limited Track Metadata**: Basic track info only (no audio features, popularity, etc.)

## Production Considerations

For production deployment, consider:

- **HTTPS Configuration**: Implement proper SSL certificates for production domains
- **Database Scaling**: Consider PostgreSQL for high-concurrency production use
- **Redis Integration**: Add caching for Spotify search results and session management
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement API rate limiting and quota management
- **Error Monitoring**: Enhanced error reporting and application monitoring
- **Security Hardening**: Proper CORS configuration, input validation, and secret management
- **Backup Strategy**: Automated database backups and disaster recovery procedures

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"INVALID_CLIENT: Insecure redirect URI"**
- Ensure Spotify redirect URI is exactly: `http://127.0.0.1:5988/api/spotify/callback`
- Use `127.0.0.1` not `localhost` for the redirect URI in Spotify app settings

**"Failed to initiate Spotify authentication"**
- Check that backend is running on port 5988
- Verify SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID is set correctly in `.env`
- Ensure database is initialized with `alembic upgrade head`

**"Failed to parse AI response"**
- Click "Show AI Response" to see the raw OpenAI output
- Try rephrasing your playlist description
- Check OPENAI_API_KEY is valid or provide a personal key

**Frontend won't connect to backend**
- Verify backend is running on `http://127.0.0.1:5988`
- Check that proxy configuration is correct in `vite.config.js`
- Ensure both frontend and backend are using correct ports

**Database migration errors**
- Delete `playmaker.db` and run `alembic upgrade head` to recreate
- Check that all migration files are present in `alembic/versions/`
- Verify DATABASE_URL in `.env` points to correct location

**Build errors on production**
- Ensure Node.js version is 18+ (20+ recommended)
- Check that all dependencies install without errors
- Verify Vite configuration supports target Node.js version
